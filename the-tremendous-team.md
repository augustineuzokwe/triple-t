# The Tremendous Team

A blast of shimmering, impossible energy detonates in the Portal Room. The air itself screams. We see MOD-E, a sleek service automaton, instantaneously reduced to a smoking, rolling cylinder with one blinking optical sensor. His parts—a hydraulic leg, a memory core, a precision manipulator—are yanked into the void, scattered like metallic confetti across the multiverse. With a determined whir, the remaining torso begins to move, his mission singular: reclaim himself.

His journey is a bizarre, desperate hunt. MOD-E rolls first into Xylos-9, a forest where trees bloom with glass leaves that chime in the wind, and gravity shifts every ten seconds. He finds his left hand, now encrusted with jade lichen, pulsing with an alien, bio-luminescent light. When he attaches it, he gains not only grip but a strange, gentle compulsion to tend the glass flora.

Next, he navigates the Ribbon World, a space where everything is stretched into two-dimensional strips. The light is blindingly thin. Here, he finds his voice box, but it is warped, capable now of emitting notes of perfect, crystalline harmony instead of speech. With each recovered piece, he grows stronger, yet increasingly unfamiliar. The composite MOD-E is faster, more versatile, but the 'original' model seems lost. He realizes the old parts are not keys to his past identity, but upgrades to a new one.

In a final, serene dimension of infinite, silent water, MOD-E finds his missing core unit. He pauses, his gleaming new hand hovering. He could install the old heart, or embrace the parts he's gathered—the clockwork mind, the singing voice. He looks out at his reflection, now a mosaic of different realities. A small, joyful spark ignites in his optical sensor.

"I like this me," he transmits.

He casts the old core into the water, watching it sink, and continues his travels, no longer searching for his past, but charting a course for his future. The last shot is MOD-E rolling across a cloud bank, his jade-lichen hand waving to a passing, rainbow-winged creature, a new, wholly original machine full of purpose and light.
